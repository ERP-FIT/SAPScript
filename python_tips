https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9698557/how-to-use-pip-on-windows-behind-an-authenticating-proxy

I ran into the same issue on windows 7. I managed to get it working by creating a "pip" folder with a "pip.ini" file inside it. I put this folder inside "C:\Users\{my.username}\AppData\Roaming", because according to the Python documentation:

On Windows the configuration file is %APPDATA%\pip\pip.ini

In the pip.ini file I have only:

[global]
proxy = [proxy address]:[proxy port]
So no username:password. And it is working just fine.
